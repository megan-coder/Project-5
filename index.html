          <h3>6 Word Memoir: Soda! It makes you throw up. 
            </h3>

                Soda is an unhealthy drink although it’s delicious it makes you throw up if you have too much and I know that from experience. I recall a time when my cousin and I were bored out of our minds at our grandparent’s picnic. We were forced to go with them ( I only went because my mom was gonna pick me up from there). The picnic was mainly centered around the adults, so we had nothing to do, and when I say nothing I mean NOTHING. We were both about to die of boredom until we decided to do a competition.

            </div>

            <div class="col-sm-3 col-md-4 col-lg-4" style="color: white; background-color: green;">
                It started out as we were hungry so we were going to eat something then it became a competition. She had challenged me to a chug off! I accepted knowing I would probably lose because my stomach was smaller at the time, but I took that chilled, mouth-watering Fanta and chugged my way to victory. After my cousin asked for a rematch so I agreed to do a few more rounds. We continued to drink different types of sodas each round. Then we were tied and I thought I was about to die, but at least I would die without an empty stomach.

                <div class="col-sm-3 col-md-2 col-lg-4" style="color: white; background-color: blue;">
                    In the end, we both ended up throwing up and having to use the bathroom so much that our grandma made us wear diapers. We also ran almost 80 million laps from all the sugar. But even now my cousin and I continue to debate on who won.

               <h3>Limerks</h3>
               There once was a giant named Katie
               She had 2 dogs which acted like babies
               And when she went downstairs.
               To check if her dogs were there.
               To her surprise they had rabies

             <h3>Success</h3>
             Success can mean different things
             And people can achieve success in many ways
             To some people they have achieved their dreams to be a success.
             For me I think the most important thing about achieving success is
             Learning something on your journey to success or have friends around you on your way to success
             Because once you become successful you want to have other people around you so you can share the story of your success
             Sometimes people become successful but they have lost friendships in the process of doing so
             And their success becomes empty
             Other people’s definition of success can change but what is most important is that
             You are happy where you are in life you have reached your goals

                <h3>Narritive Poem</h3>
                  Long Ago The 8 Planets Lived in Harmony
Until The Sun People Attacked.
I was born when the war had already reached its peak
Pluto was the Planet That was hit the most
Because of That, I am the last person from Pluto

My name is Patience but I don’t have any
Everyday people struggle to live
While the sun nation continues to attack earth other planets are forced to work for The sun nation.
“Patience, Dinner!” her mother announced

“I’m Coming!” I said
“Jeez” I muttered
 “So what's for dinner” I said
“Not much, just some stale bread with pasta” her mother replied

“Seriously not again” I replied
“Don’t you ever get tired of Eating the same Scraps every day, while the sun Nation get All the good food”
“Not really.” Her mother replied

“Someone has to do something about this.”
“What if I start a rebellion?”
“ I wouldn’t try that, even if you did start one you would be severely punished ” 
“So” I yelled
“I am trying to say is don't try to join one at All,” She said sometimes you can’t always fix everything but try to have hope.”
“Fine“
“Too bad I already have plans to join one anyway. “
I muttered quiet enough that only I could hear.
Tonight I will escape. I went to the nearest portal.
I decided to go to Earth.
But there are lots of sun troops so I have to be careful.
It’s not like A leader of a rebellion would come up to me to ask If I would like to join.
Things aren’t that easy nowadays.
Nearby I see a tavern
I know I am a bit too young to enter but who knows.
They might just let me in.
“What's The Password” I hear a gruff voice say
What password I thought to myself.
“Down with the Sun Nation?” I ask 
“Welcome to training” 
“What do mean training” I ask
“ Well it’s combat training of course”
“Ohhh that makes sense”
“Meet your leaders,” Said the man
From what I am told these are my leaders
Luna can cast darkness over any area.
Maria can control any type of land or rock.
Next is Lexi. She can control water.
Last but never least our captain Trish.
She doesn’t have any powers but she is a very good leader.
Tomorrow is when we attack.
I try to get a good night’s sleep but I can’t get over the fact that about 5 days ago I thought that this war would never end but now I’m about to end.
Today is the day.
I pack my stuff and get ready because today is the end of the hundred year war
We take the secret portal that we built overtime to get to the sun.
Not gonna lie, it is very hot here.
Thank goodness for luna or we would’ve all melted without some shade.
The battle begins first we must sneak into the palace.
We made it in now we have to find the throne room.
Quickly and Quietly we plan our strategy.
Trish and her team (that includes me)
Will take out the guards.
Lexi and her team will then go for the sun lord.
“Remember to trust yourselves and don’t be afraid.” Said Trish
Our plan worked! 
“We Won!”
Now the war has ended And I learned something during all this.
I learned to never doubt myself and to always stand up for what is right.

                  <h3>Spring</h3>
                  Verse:
Spring is a new season
Enjoy the wind in your face
Enjoy the breeze
Laying in the grass 
With the sun in you face 
Warm weather,  damp and muddy
But nothing can compete with this.
I know it sounds different but just relax inside the mist

Chorus:
Spring it's a feeling.
Spring it's a feeling.

Verse:
Spring it a new experience
After being in 2 seasons 
Which had an Icy twist
Now we have warm weather 
That still exists?
Seeing green grass growing everywhere it's a great thing.		
You know the saying April showers bring May Flowers
Well it's true
One month its muddy and the next you see flowers bloom

Now that you understand spring in it´s think about it mist and all it's wonderful gifts

                  Chorus: Space is a mysterious place (x2) 
      Verse: Space is full of dark matter, mysterious matter, empty matter.
       More crazy than the Mad Hatter.
       Space it's a mysterious place exploring moving around without gravity to be bound. It's empty, long, endless, reckless and restless.
       Planets moving and Grooving all the time. Spinning without rhyme adding years at a certain time.
       Days are different on planets all the time.
      Chorus: Space is a mysterious place (x2) 
      Verse:  Revolving around the sun in the universe within the milky way .
       Stars are all around and can be found in another way.
       Balls of radiant dust if we must, see them to believe them. 
      That’s what we trust
